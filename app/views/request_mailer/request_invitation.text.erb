Hello,

Someone has requested an invitation to <%= root_url %>, the private photo-sharing website for <%= @mom_name %>'s child <%= @child_name %>. You can review the details below.

Name: <%= @request.name %>
Email: <%= @request.email %>
How They Know <%= @mom_name %>: <%= @request.how_they_know %>

If the information they provided seems legitimate, you can invite them at:

<%= new_invitation_url(:user) %>

Thanks,

<%= @admin_name %>

P.S.: If you have any questions or concerns, or notice any buggy site behavior, please feel free to contact me at <%= link_to @support_email, "mailto:#{ @support_email }" %> rather than <%= @mom_name %> directly.
